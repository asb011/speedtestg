# Speed Test G FAQ

## 1. Where can I download Speed Test G so I can try it on my device?
You can't. Sorry. The sole reason is that I don't want smartphone makers to have access to this code and then try to "cheat" the system.
The idea is that this test remains independent and trustworthy.

## 2. Can Speed Test G run on iOS?
No. The test suite is written specifically for Android. In the future it may be possible to create a port to iOS, however, that is a long-term 
possibility, not a short-term goal.

## 3. Can you compare the latest Snapdragon with the latest Apple processor?
Please see question #2.

## 4. Why don't you do 5/10/50/100 test runs to ensure that the results are consistent?
Before recording, we do multiple test runs to ensure that the results we are seeing are correct. This includes running the tests from a known
state (i.e. after a reboot, etc). To ensure that CPU throttling (due to heat) isn't an issue the devices are left to cool before each test
run and before the recording of the final test. All tests are done in airplane mode. See question #5 for more.

## 5. Are the results consistent?
Yes. For example, three different test runs on three different days on the Pixel 3 XL yielded the times of 1:49.26, 1:49.27, and 1:49.33.
If a device is showing a difference of more than 1 (maximum 2) seconds between tests then showing isn't right then
the device/environment/conditions need to be examined.

## 6. Is it fair to compare a device on Android X compared to Android Y?
Yes, for two reasons. First, this is a device test. This means that when you buy the device, this is what you get. If the device underperforms
because of a software issue then consumers need to know that. Second, there are rarely major advances in Android performance from one version
to the next. It does happen, for example when Android moved from Davlik to ART, but that doesn't happen every day! If and when that becomes
a factor then it will be duly noted during the test run.

## 7. I read on a forum that if you tweak X and flash Y and alter Z then my device will run faster
That may well be true, but here we are testing the devices as supplied by the manufacturers.

## 8. Device XYZ has a Turbo mode/Performance mode/Burst mode/Game mode. Did you enable that before the test?
The devices are used in their defaults configurations. If the relevant performance mode is enabled by default that is how the device is
tested. Occasionally, if warranted, we may perform two tests, one with the mode enabled and one with it disabled.

## 9. Why haven't you tested Device SPQR? I have asked several times on social media or in the comments.
For one of two reasons. 1) The device isn't that interesting. Sorry. 2) But more likely, I don't have access to that device at the moment.
I don't have a huge box with every released device which I just open and take the device for the next video. Devices are expensive. 
Sometimes I can borrow a device. Sometimes my teammates have access to the device and I can use that. Sometimes I need to buy the device
and hope to sell it afterwards.
